# A Better Browser

This final paper was overly ambitious and cobbled together during a reading period to satisfy the requirements for CS342s, which had fallen apart by the end of the semester. While I am passionate about browser technology and consider the Chrome Comic with illustrations by Scott McCloud to be one of the best technical explinations I've ever read, I feel this paper fell short of adding to its intended conversation. Not enough research, because there was not enough time. The bulk of this paper was written over one long day in the middle of Duke's reading period for finals.

I tried.
